# Final Presentation：

## Concept 
"Dream" is an immersive VR experience game where players assume the role of a dreamer and explore within the dream world. Players will venture into a dream-like environment filled with seemingly rational yet inexplicable events and scenes. By exploring, they will uncover hidden plot Easter eggs within the game's progression, gradually unraveling the complete storyline of this dream world.

## Inspiration

##### We drew inspiration for this game from two dreams.。


Dream 1:

A group of people went on a trip to a remote town, where the relatives of one of the companions lived. In the narrow alleyways, there was a group of elderly people, each with some form of disability, mostly facial disfigurements. The relative of the companion was an elderly woman dressed entirely in black, with her eyes covered by a black cloth. The town's men were all required to join the war effort, and due to the hasty recruitment, only a few managed to return, most of them with severe disabilities. Later, a doctor arrived in the town, carrying a black box (ITeM). If people made a wish, they could undergo limb transplants, sacrificing their own organs to obtain functional limbs. Initially, people only sacrificed their eyeballs to regain the limbs they lost in the war. However, they gradually started engaging in trades and crimes, using kidnapping and violence to forcibly transfer limbs and eyeballs from others to themselves, using these spare body parts for trade or engaging in even more violent acts. As a result, the number of deaths increased, and those who obtained spare organs often dreamed of living together with the deceased. (From Kun Ouyang)

Dream 2:

During a training program I attended, we had an extracurricular activity to visit a theater. As we walked to the backstage area, it resembled a large warehouse with shelves dividing the space. Directors and actors stood in each section, discussing the script. We joined them in the discussion. As we passed through the shelves, I noticed many familiar faces of my former classmates, but they seemed to not recognize me. I found it strange but continued discussing theater with the directors. After a while, feeling exhausted, I took a rest on an oil drum near the door. In a daze, I overheard them calling for everyone to gather, but I hesitated to respond. Soon, a person approached me, expressing a sense of unease about the situation. However, before I could inquire further, the director loudly called us to gather, stating that we had to continue rehearsals over the weekend and couldn't rest. Thanks to the warning from the person, my guard was up. The person then gathered my high school classmates, who surprisingly regained consciousness. We realized that we had gotten lost in reminiscing about our high school days. We began to search for an exit and ended up in what seemed like a large abandoned factory. As we continued walking and chatting, one of my friends mentioned needing to use the restroom. They walked in a different direction, and I saw a male classmate trip and fall after reaching a giant rock. I rushed over to find his head and arms bruised, with a panicked and fearful expression. I fetched band-aids, but to my surprise, all his injuries had disappeared when I arrived, and he asked me with a smile, "How did you get here?" I sensed that something was off. How could all his wounds vanish so quickly? As I returned to my luggage, fear gripped me, and with that fear, I noticed things I hadn't seen before. Along the roadside, in the wilderness, and near dilapidated houses, there were scattered corpses of mermaids—some mummified, some decaying. My fear reached its peak, and I shouted. My friends gathered around, asking what had happened, but they didn't seem concerned. The classmate who had tripped and fallen also smiled without any injuries. I noticed another left-handed classmate who now seemed more inclined to use their right hand. I was terrified, feeling that these people were not my classmates. In a trembling voice, I yelled, and as I shouted, "my friends" transformed into hideous mermaid faces. I sprinted forward, desperate to escape these horrifying beings, but fear weakened my legs, causing me to stumble and struggle to run. Finally, I fell onto a large bundle of fabric, sitting as I pushed myself backward. They slowly closed in, and as I stepped on something, I was propelled into the air, ultimately crashing into a train station. Without hesitation, I rushed towards a departing subway train and boarded it. Staring out the window, I worried that those grotesque mermaids would catch up, but they didn't. Instead, many villagers were at the station, carrying various items, preparing to board the train. Finally, the train started, and after passing through a narrow passage and taking a turn, I began observing the villagers around me. Sitting next to me was a person of my age, wearing blue camouflage clothing and carrying a large backpack. They mentioned having just finished military service and were now heading home. Hearing this, I shivered. Inland, there was no sea. How could there be military service here? Why would someone return alone after completing their service? Why did it feel like everyone was occasionally looking at me? Why was I the first one to board the train? Where was this train really taking me? Was I truly safe? (From Kunanbayi Shugela)

#### We combined the two dream scenarios and discussed to create the following complete story.
### Chapter1: War Unleashed
The player awakens in a trench, recovering from unconsciousness. NPCs dig them out of the soil, surrounded by the sounds of explosions and the chaos of war.
-The photograph on the player falls to the ground with a doctored look. The player picks up the photo and continues to escape with the NPC.
(The player can jump and observe the war-torn environment but cannot jump out of the trench. At the end of the trench, there is a bus with its doors open.)
(Upon escaping, they discover that it was actually a movie set.)

### Chapter 2: The Mysterious Tram
The player and NPCs gather at the end of a trench and board a London bus. Before boarding, the player notices a wounded soldier sitting in the dark corner of the bus's back seat. There is no driver, but the bus continues to move. (The player can freely move around the bus and during the activity, they can see a film studio in the distance.) (The bus starts moving, lasting about 10 seconds.)
As the player gets off the bus, they notice that the wounded soldier's legs have transformed into a mermaid tail, setting the stage for the upcoming scene.
(Program requirements: The lights dim, and the soldier's legs turn into a mermaid tail. Then, the lights come back on, accompanied by the sound of bones growing.)

### Chapter 3: The Strange Warehous
After getting off the bus, the player enters a warehouse, and the warehouse doors close.
The player enters a large warehouse where props are stored, and many NPCs are busy inside.
OS: These people are all the ones in my photos.
The player attempts to interact with the familiar people in the photos, using flashbacks and blinking to determine if they are mermaids. They notice some clues, their sanity (san) decreases, and the warehouse doors open (forcing the player out). After leaving the warehouse, there is a sprint, and when the player gets tired, player stop to rest on the road. They realize that the photos are missing. At this moment, three people approach from behind (one of them naturally disabled, missing an arm), and they return the photos to the player. During the exchange, the player notices that all NPCs are blinking, indicating that they are normal people. Feeling exhausted, the protagonist decides to take a rest and lets the three of them go ahead. After resting, the player continues on the journey and encounters the previously disabled person again. During the interaction, they notice that the person no longer blinks and their disability has been cured. The sanity decreases, and a black mermaid tail appears behind them, starting a chase.

### Chapter 4: The Escaping Bus
The player rushes towards a bus that is about to depart and is allowed to board by an elderly ticket seller.
The player is worried about being pursued by mermaids, but once the bus starts moving, the villagers around them sit quietly.
The player sits next to a person who has just completed their military service (missing legs) and learns that they are heading back home.

### Chapter 5: The Violent and Sacrificial Village
The bus arrives at a remote village where people exchange their eyelids for limbs or communicate with the dead.
People engage in frantic trading and criminal activities, leading to an increasing number of deaths.
The player discovers that people have started trading eyelids in order to communicate and live with the deceased.
Upon exploring a church, the player encounters a doctor (plague doctor) with a parchment on the table containing the rules. After closing the reading interface, the player realizes that the doctor has approached them from a distance, causing a decrease in sanity. The church becomes filled with corpses, bones, and bloodstains, and the screen gradually turns black. Once the screen is completely black, a sentence appears: "Someone is waiting for your eyelids."
After taking off the VR headset, a person wearing a mask stands in front of the player.

## Game Style:
The game style incorporates elements of Gothic, Medieval, Lovecraftian, andAnti-war themes.
